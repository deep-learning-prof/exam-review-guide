# exam-review-guie

The objective of this guide is to help you study for the exam. Since the exam is open book,
open internet, etc, the answer to the questions will not be found online. As a result, using
the Internet during the exam will most likely by counterproductive. I recommend that you study
assuming that you will not have access to the internet. This will minimize the time it will
take you to complete the exam. I estimate it will take you less than 1 hour to complete the
exam. 

## What you need to know about Machine Learning
We started the course talking about basic machine learning concepts. You should know the
following about this topic:

1. Explain capacity, overfitting, and underfitting​ 
   1.1 You should know what is capacity and what parameters of a deep neural network can be modified to
   increase or decrease the capacity. 
   1.2 You should know what is overfitting, what causes it, and how it affects the performance of the model. 
   1.3 You should know what is underfitting, what causes it, and how it affects the performance
   of the model. 

2. Explain regularization​
    2.1 You should know what is regularization, what is the purpose of regularization, and give
    on example of regularization. 

3. Explain hyperparameters and validation sets​
    3.1 You should know what is a hypeparameter
    3.2 You should know what is a validation set and how it differs from testing and training sets. 

4. Explain maximum likelihood estimators​
    4.1  You should know what is a maximum likelihood estimator. 
    4.2 You should know why we use macimum likelihood etimators (i.e., what is the advantage)

5. Why deep learning?
    5.1 You should know what are the limitations of traditional machine learning
    5.2 You should know how deep learning addresses those limitations. 
    
## Convolutional Neural Networks
After covering machine learning basics, we started talking about deep feed forward networks in
general.  We will skip that part in this exam. Hence, the next topic is CNNs. ​

1. Describe a CNN​
    1.1 You should know what is the difference between a traditional deep feedforward network and a
    convolutional network. 
2. Describe the convolution operation​
    2.1 You should be able to describe the convolution operation
    2.2 You should be able to compute the convolution operation given a small example
    
3. Describe the advantage of using the convolution operation​. 
    3.1 You should know why we use the convolution operation
    3.2 You should knwo what type of data is best suited for convolution operations and why. 

4. Pooling
    4.1 You should be able to describe what is pooling and compute the value in a small example
    4.2 You should know what is the kernel/filter
    4.3 You should be able to explain why we use pooling after a convolutional layer

5. Stochastic gradient descent
    5.1 You should be able to explain the intuition behind stochastic gradient descent. 
    5.2. You should be able to explain what is a batch and a mini-batch
    5.3 You should be ale to explain how batches are used in stochastic gradient descent. 


## Recurrent Neural Networks
Finally, we covered RNNs. 

1. Motivation for RNNs
    1.1 You should be able to explain when RNNs are better suited than CNNs

2. Describe RNNs
    2.1 You should be able to describe a computational graph
    2.2 You should be able to describe how different RNN architectures can be used for
        different tasks as well as their advantages and disadvantages. 

3. Describe a encoder-decoder architecture and what are its advantages. 
    
## Labs

1. You should be able to apply the concepts from CNN and ML basics to train a CNN and/or RNN    
   model given a certain data set. 

2. Given the results of training and testing,  you should be able to change the model
   and training parameters to improve its performance. 

3. You should be able to explain why certain changes to the model and training parameters
   improve or degrade performance.
